title: "Consider watching: <i>Turandot</i>, Beijing 1998"
---

Opera is, understandably, a difficult genre for many people. It's usually in a
foreign language like Italian or German (and thus hard to tell what's going on),
sung in a style which to the uninitiated sounds "grating" and "wailing", and
appears pretentious and snobbish due to how unaccessible it is. Despite this, I
think it's a fantastic form of entertainment that anyone can appreciate given
the right exposure.

Regardless of whether or not you enjoy opera, you should check out the [Beijing
1998 production of _Turandot_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq9kB71yDs0){:target="_blank"}
in the Forbidden City --- not necessarily to watch it start to finish, but to
appreciate that such a piece of art even exists. I wanted to give some
background here on why I think it's incredible.

## About _Turandot_ itself
Giacomo Puccini (one of the great Italian opera composers) began working on
_Turandot_ in March 1920. The work is best contextualized as part of the 20th
century revival of
[chinoiserie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinoiserie){:target="_blank"}, or
the fascination and emulation of traditional Chinese style in Western culture
--- a period which also produced the Vanderbilt family's Chinese Tea House in
Newport (1913) and [influenced wealthy women's
fashion](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Chinese_Summer_dress.png){:target="_blank"}.

Far outside of Puccini's typical
[_verismo_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verismo){:target="_blank"} genre, the
opera is set in mythical ancient China, and follows the trials of Prince Calaf
as he seeks Princess Turandot's hand in marriage. In composing the music,
Puccini relied heavily on pentatonic scales (used in traditional Chinese music)
and quoted some Chinese tunes directly from sources that were available to him.
The most famous tune of these is _Mòlihuā_ (茉莉花), which is used throughout
the opera as a leitmotif for Princess Turandot. By incorporating these elements,
_Turandot_ acquires a tonal profile wholly distinct from some of Puccini's other
well-known works, e.g. _La bohème_ and _Tosca_.

	scan, titled &ldquo;The Guiding March&rdquo; is quoted e.g. by Pong in Act II,
	&ldquo;Sprimaccerò per lei le molli piume!&rdquo;</figcaption>
</figure>

The work itself is a flawed masterpiece. The plot leaves much to be desired.
Prince Calaf is a flat character who falls in love too quickly; the tone shift
from Liù's death is jarringly abrupt. And of course, with all works of the
chinoiserie movement, there is the question of whether or not this "cultural
appropriation", with its racial stereotypes and "theft" of traditional Chinese
tunes, is problematic.

In my opinion, given the time period, Puccini did the best with what he had, and
the sheer grandeur of his setting of the music points to his respect towards the
culture, not a mockery of it. In no other opera have I found quite the same
sumptuous splendor as is composed into _Turandot_ (and of course, one can't talk
about _Turandot_ without mentioning [Nessun
dorma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWc7vYjgnTs){:target="_blank"}, its most
famous aria and indeed perhaps the most famous aria in all of opera). We may be
a little more forgiving of the flaws in the plot, as Puccini died with the work
unfinished, leaving the finale to be tacked on by later writers. Finally, I take
the actions of the characters in the opera to be a part of Puccini's soaring
imagination of a fantastical land, and not at all a representation or commentary
on Chinese people as a whole.

Nevertheless, performance of _Turandot_ was blocked in China for decades after
its composition, as the government believed it portrayed China in a negative
light. That is, until the late 1990s; here is where the story of the Beijing
1998 production of _Turandot_ begins.

## _Turandot_ in Beijing
It's probably no accident that the Chinese government relenting on its
_Turandot_ ban in the 1990s coincides with its broader foreign policy at the
time under Jiang Zemin --- increasing cooperation and goodwill with the West.
Here was one such physical manifestation of this cooperation; the opera would be
conducted by Zubin Mehta, a world-renowned conductor who had worked with the LA,
Vienna, and Berlin Philharmonic orchestras, and the stage direction would be led
by Zhang Yimou, perhaps the most prominent, internationally acclaimed Chinese
filmmaker.

It would turn out to be a collaboration of international cultures, as well;
though _Turandot_ is a Western opera, Zhang would incorporate many elements of
Peking opera, including its heavily reliance on symbolism, stylized body
language, martial arts, and use of flags to convey events (rather than a typical
performance of Western opera, in which sets are designed to mimic the true
setting and character actions should be taken literally).

Accordingly, Zhang ordered the construction of two pavilions in the
architectural style of the palace, whose simple movements across the stage would
symbolize scene changes. These pavilions each weighed 2-3 tons, and were pushed
by stage hands during the show. Of course, necessary infrastructure such as
speakers and lights had to be installed as well, since the palace square is
normally just an open, empty space.

The sheer scale of the project is astounding. Zhang wanted all costumes to be
based on traditional, authentic designs from historical Chinese courts, so
hundreds of people worked to hand-embroider robes for the performers,
referencing historical depictions of Ming emperors.

There were also one hundred dancers training for six hours a day to learn the
Peking opera-inspired choreography as part of the production.

They even got a few hundred reserve men from the People's Liberation Army to
serve as Ming soldiers and drummers on stage.

Alongside another few hundred members of the Orchestra del Maggio Musicale
Fiorentino and chorus, it's no exaggeration to say that this _Turandot_ was the
collective art of people from all over the world --- and a powerful symbol of
what we as the human species can achieve through international friendship and
collaboration. Take a moment and watch a few minutes of [the closing scene from
this production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEmD0CwRRQw){:target="_blank"},
where Zhang Yimou directs all of his dancers and extras to come back out on the
set in a final display of stage direction brilliance, and Zubin Mehta conducts
the orchestra and chorus in a triumphant reprise of the "Nessun Dorma" theme.
Note the elaborate, hand-embroidered costumes, and the two pavilions which
anchor the scene. This is an interweaving of the hard work and practice of
thousands of artists; a unification of culture thousands of years in the making,
from the very palace steps where the Ming emperor would have stood in the 13th
century, to Puccini's opera itself descended from a long tradition of Western
classical music. The joining of Italian libretti with Peking opera dance. The
setting aside of political tensions and cultural differences in favor of the
human pursuit of beauty.

During the final moments of the show, signholders on stage turn portraits of
emperors to reveal two sets of Chinese characters in gold on blue panels. It is
the intertwining of two poems from the Ming dynasty. Below are the characters
transcribed from left to right (with a line break where the emperor sits, in
the middle); the blue characters make up one of the poems,
and the red characters make up the other.

<p style="text-align:center">
<span style="color:#035E7B">四海昇平翠幄雍容探六籍</span><span style="color:#9E0101">萬方玉帛風雲會</span>
<br>
<span style="color:#035E7B">萬幾清暇瑶編披覽惜三馀</span><span style="color:#9E0101">一统山河日月明</span>
</p>

The blue poem can be found inscribed in the entryway of the [Hall of Literary
Brilliance
(Wenhuadian)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_of_Literary_Brilliance){:target="_blank"}
in the Forbidden City. It can be roughly translated as (to my best effort,
apologies for any inaccuracies here):

<p>
<b>四海昇平　</b><i>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Seas" target="_blank">four seas</a> are tranquil</i><br>
<b>翠幄雍容　</b><i>Gracefully beneath the jade-green canopy</i><br>
<b>探六籍　　</b><i>He [the emperor] studies the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Books_and_Five_Classics" target="_blank">Six Classics</a></i>
</p>

<p>
<b>萬幾清暇　</b><i>Leisure amongst ten thousand state affairs</i><br>
<b>瑶編披覽　</b><i>He reads his precious jade-bound books</i><br>
<b>惜三馀　　</b><i>Cherishing the Three Surpluses</i>
</p>

(According to Dong Yu of the Han Dynasty, the Three Surpluses are times
where people can finally study instead of working; winter, as there is no
farming to do, night, as there is no light, and rainy days, when work outside
cannot proceed).

The red poem is said to have been a call-and-response between Emperor Chengzu,
the third emperor of the Ming dynasty, and his grandson the crown prince Zhu
Zhanji (who would later become Emperor Xuanzong, the fifth emperor). Chengzu,
wishing to test his grandson's literary acumen, posed to him the first half of a
couplet: 「萬方玉帛風雲會」 (_From ten thousand places, jade and silk converge
like the wind and the clouds_). Zhu Zhanji, being very sharp, immediately bowed
his head and completed the couplet: 「一统山河日月明」(_The mountains and rivers
are unified; the sun and moon are bright_).

Of course, the poems mirror the end of _Turandot_, where the icy Princess
Turandot finally joins hands with the fiery Prince Calaf. But I'd like to think
they are also displayed, in the context of the rest of this production of
_Turandot_ in Beijing, as a shared, hopeful message for global peace and unity.
