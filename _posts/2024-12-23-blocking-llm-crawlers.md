I've started blocking bots from major AI companies which my crawl my site for
the purposes of training large language models (LLMs), the likes of which
include GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, and Meta AI.

I am using the `robots.txt` put together by the
[ai.robots.txt](https://github.com/ai-robots-txt/ai.robots.txt/tree/main){:target="_blank"}
project, storing it in the root directory of my GitHub Pages repository.
