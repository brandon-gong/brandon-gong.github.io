						<p>
							Most notably, policemen and other first responders found themselves in "dire need" â€” as
							Colonel Anthony Rudolph put it â€” of
							face masks for them to wear as they continued to serve the community. To fill this gap, I,
							along with three other high school
							students, led a fundraiser in which over $1,500 was raised to purchase and donate 2,500
							masks to Memphis and Collierville
							police stations.

							Our project was called <b>901PPE</b> â€” 901 being our local area code, and PPE standing for
							both "personal protective equipment"
							and "Protecting Police Effectively".
						</p>
						<p>
							To increase public awareness of our effort, I designed and built <a
								href="https://901ppe.org/">901PPE.org</a>. The website would
							not only increase the legitimacy of 901PPE; it would serve as an important fundraising tool,
							allowing potential donors to quickly
							locate the <a
								href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-provide-masks-for-officers-in-shelby-county">GoFundMe
								page</a> or read more about our mission and motivations. As a link, it would be shorter
							and more memorable than the lengthy GoFundMe URL, meaning
							it could be easily shared and spread in our community.

						<img src="901ppe/masks.jpg" class="fullimg">
						<p class="caption">Our second of three shipments of masks. We had to use different sources
							because of the limited supply around the world.</p>
						<p>
							Within days of going online, 901PPE.org racked up hundreds of views from 5 different
							countries as people shared the link to
							their own friends and inner circles both locally and around the globe. As the ripple effect
							continued, donations began to pour
							in; by the time we ended the fundraiser, almost one hundred people â€” some friends, but the
							majority being names I did not
							recognize â€” had pitched in to our cause.
						</p>
						<p>
							Today, 901PPE.org remains up and serves both to document the delivery of the masks and its
							coverage on local media, as well as to
							be a token of gratitude to the generous donors that made the project possible.
						</p>
						<p>
							In designing the website, I took several key factors into consideration. The website:
							<ul style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif">
								<li>
									Had to be visually impactful. If it did not grab attention immediately, potential
									donors could lose interest upon
									clicking the link. Additionally, a visually impactful website would make the project
									as a whole look more well-organized
									and carefully planned, meaning that potential donors could trust where their money
									was going.
								</li>
								<li>
									Needed to be simple enough that navigation is extremely intuitive and usable. In
									other words, the time looking for
									the donation link needed to be minimized, and information about us and our mission
									needed to be prominently displayed
									to eliminate their need to go digging themselves.
								</li>
								<li>
									Had to be mobile-friendly, and flexible enough to adapt to any kind of device,
									display, browser, etc. Knowing that the
									link would be shared primarily through text and social media such as Instagram,
									Twitter, and Snapchat, mobile-friendliness
									was a key priority.
								</li>
								<li>
									Should have a flexible design that can be changed later. I wanted donors to be able
									to return to this website even after
									the project had ended and still feel familiar with its layout. Thus, even though I
									swapped out links and added new
									content when the project was closed, it still retained the same general flow as
									before. The website was specifically
									designed not to be overly dependent on specific links but instead to be modular
									enough that the feeling of familiarity is
									retained.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<img src="901ppe/landing.jpg" class="fullimg">
						<p class="caption">The landing page of 901PPE.org.</p>
						<p>
							With all these requirements in consideration, I opted to go with a clean, minimalist
							interface based around the symbolic colors
							representative of the police force â€” black, white, and blue â€” and use a single-page flow so
							that users would not have to deal with
							navigation bars, hamburger menus, or dropdowns that could be a pain to deal with (there
							still is a navbar, but it merely scrolls
							to different sections of the same page).
						</p>
						<img src="901ppe/mission.jpg" class="fullimg">
						<p class="caption">Our mission is easily accessible and boldly contrasted with the rest of the
							page so that it is hard to miss.</p>
						<p>
							Finally, I wanted to add some personality, something unique and memorable to the site. When
							the user first loads into 901PPE.org,
							they will see the 901PPE logo surrounded by strange, moving spheres that orbit, connecting
							when they get close together. To me,
							this sketch (coded in WebGL and p5.js) has symbolic importance:
						</p>
						<p>
							As we all travel the path of our own lives, separated from others whether by age, financial
							situation, religious beliefs, race,
							or a contagious virus, it can be easy to grow distant and uncaring to the struggles and
							needs of others. However, it can be
							immensely rewarding to form that new connection, and encourage others nearby to do the same,
							creating a rewarding experience
							for everyone involved. And though as time goes on, and the paths we tread diverge, and the
							connections we make may break,
							the impact lasts forever.
						</p>
						<p>
							This, I believe, is the central message of 901PPE, one that inspired me when I first began
							organizing it as well as one that
							has impacted me permanently in return.

							Every year, our school's math team hosts a "Math Bowl" â€” a fast-paced, buzzer style
							competition featuring math teams from surrounding schools in the Mississippi and
							Tennessee area.
						</p>
						<p>
							The competition lasts a whole day, with preliminary round robin matches taking place
							in the morning followed by a lunch break and a double-elimination tournament in the
							afternoon.  Generally, around 20 teams participate, and matches are spread out in
							10 different classrooms for the preliminary rounds and then moved into a larger
							auditorium space for the final rounds of the tournament.
						</p>
						<img src="mathbowl/room1.jpg" class="fullimg">
						<p class="caption">A round currently in progress (with my software running on the TV)</p>
						<p>
							The background work required to both coordinate and run the event is immense.
							Traditionally, round results have been "run" by student volunteers on paper slips,
							where they would be manually recorded and counted up by a teacher.  Timekeeping was
							done on wristwatches or cell phones, and the score would be tallied by hand on the
							whiteboard.
						</p>
						<p>
							The first time I volunteered as a part of this event, my head was already teeming with
							ideas on how to streamline this old-fashioned process.
						</p>
						<p>
							I began working on a website.  I built the whole thing from scratch; the layouts,
							the logic, the style were all conscious and intentional decisions by me.  The only
							third-party software I used was Firebase (though, in hindsight, I probably should
							have also used React or Vue.js instead of manipulating the DOM using vanilla JS, which,
							as you may see with the code, leads to some pretty ugly and unreadable results).

						<p>
							The result of about a month's work of work was <i>mathbowl.brandongong.org</i>, a
							massive, multi-faceted piece of software that helped cover almost all of the tedious
							work with the old paper system.  It was a timer, scorekeeping, and management system
							all rolled into one.  Features included:
							<ul style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif">
								<li>
									<b>Flexible roster updates:</b> New teams can be added, removed, or renamed through the admin
									dashboard.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Volunteer room assignments:</b> New rooms can be added and removed, and volunteers can be
									assigned or reassigned through the admin dashboard.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Round Robin match auto-generation algorithm:</b> automatically generate the morning match
									schedule, ensuring no team is in the same round twice and giving rooms an equal
									number of breaks.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Unique account system for rooms:</b> each room has its own login associated with the
									room number for running matches and submitting scores.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Match queuing:</b> each room has a set schedule of matches it is assigned to run;
									these matches automatically appear in a list on screen, so it is easy to load the next
									round.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Synchronized round start:</b> each room cannot skip ahead or start rounds ahead of time,
									to ensure rounds start and finish at around the same times (minimizing the wait times
									for the students between rounds).
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Customized display for each round:</b> teams entering rooms are able to see their
									team names on the screen, to verify that they are in the right place.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Score and time display:</b> teams are able to see the score and timer as the round
									progresses, as well as the current question number.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Keyboard shortcuts for timer and score operation:</b> Volunteers can operate the timer
									with maximum speed and ease, which is critical as this is a time-sensitive tournament.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Live score updates:</b> In the auditorium, where parents and coaches waited between rounds,
									the scores for each room are updated live on the large projector display.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Admin dashboard analytics:</b> On the front page of the admin dashboard, people in charge of the
									competition can view analytics for question difficulty and team performance.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Admin dashboard progress monitoring:</b> On the front page of the admin dashboard, there is a
									pie chart of rooms that have not started their rounds, rooms that are currently running a round,
									and rooms that have completed the round.  This can be used to check on rooms that are having
									issues or to know when to allow teams to move to their next round.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Round completion detection:</b> The software automatically determines when a round is complete
									or if the round should continue with tiebreakers if the score is even.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Automatic score reporting:</b> as each round is finished, scores are automatically recorded
									in the database.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Schedule display between rounds:</b> especially in the afternoon, as teams become eliminated,
									the schedule is not set for which team will appear in which room.  To aid this, the display
									in the auditorium can automatically show where teams are supposed to be for the next round.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Admin console display control:</b> The display in the auditorium can be controlled via a click
									of a button in the admin dashboard, and toggled between various display modes.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Disputes management system:</b> If, after a round, there are disputes on certain questions,
									scores can be modified, added, or deleted in the admin console.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Rank calculation algorithm:</b> Teams are ranked from preliminary round results based on total
									wins; if some teams have the same number of wins, the tie is broken by total number of questions
									answered corrrectly.  This is useful in determining seeds for the double-elimination bracket.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Graceful disconnect recovery:</b> If the Wi-Fi suddenly is disconnected during a round, the round
									can continue, and results will be reported automatically behind the scenes when a connection
									is reestablished.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Abandonment/disqualification cleaning:</b> If a team drops out or is disqualified between rounds,
									the system can automatically find and delete matches originally queued with that team.
								</li>

							On the day of the Math Bowl, I (do I even need to say this?) was extremely nervous.  I had taken this
							responsibility upon myself, to build something so large and complex in such a short time period;
							if it broke, the competition itself would break.  I had never tested it on such a scale; sure, I had
							tested it on two or three computers at once, but not with volunteers who had never seen the software
							before.
						</p>
						<p>
							The outcome, however, makes me remember why I love to code in the first place.  Everything ran more smoothly
							than I could have imagined. Besides a few hiccups in round one (in which some scores somehow got reported twice,
							glitching the rank calculation algorithm) which were quickly resolved, the day went incredibly well.

							It is hard to relate the satisfaction and pride I felt as I sat watching the admin dashboard â€” which my own
							hands had built â€” as the first scores first began to trickle in.
						</p>
						<p>
							It is even harder to describe the feeling that I felt as I watched others benefit from my work, whether they were 
							participants, volunteers, parents, or teachers.  And it is this feeling that will continue to motivate me to keep
							creating and building in the future.

							According to the USDA, approximately 133 billion pounds of food was wasted
							in 2010.
						</p>
						<p>
							We throw away old or bruised apples; we toss out peels; we cut off huge chunks
							of fruits and vegetables due to the presence of one small brown spot.
						</p>
						<p>
							At the same time, the land we live on continues to be deprived of nutrients
							and the soil must be artificially augmented with chemical fertilizers in order
							to continue to support our wasteful food demands.
						</p>
						<img src="cris/info.jpg" class="fullimg">
						<p class="caption"></p>
						<p>
							Composting is one tool to remedy this growing problem.  By returning nutrients from
							organic materials back to the soil instead of shipping them off to landfills,
							composting is an environmentally-friendly way to cut food waste as well as costs for
							other items such as fertilizers.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, composting is a daunting process to get into; it is often unclear to beginners
							what can and cannot be composted, and in what ratio to compost different food items to
							achieve the best soil qualities.
						</p>
						<p>
							To remedy this, I partnered with Collierville High School's Upcycle Club to create an
							app that would make it easier to find information about composting.
						</p>
						<p>
							The app was named "CRIS", or Compost Recognition Image Software; however, its features
							extend beyond its name.  While its primary feature is indeed a camera that can recognize
							compost scraps and recommend the best strategy to work with them, users can also read
							helpful curated articles about tips and tricks to achieve the best results, and they can
							also browse the catalog using an intelligent custom-built search engine.
						</p>
						<img src="cris/1.jpg" class="fullimg">

						bar on top can be used to search manually for the item as well, as seen in the image below.</p>
						<img src="cris/6.jpg" class="fullimg">
						<p>
							This was the first mobile app I ever built.  For maximum flexibility, I chose to use
							React Native, and used Google Cloud Vision for the image recognition part.  The app ran on
							iOS and Android platforms, and was routinely tested using devices of different resolutions
							and operating systems to ensure maximum compatibility.  The information in the app was
							compiled with the gracious help of the CHS Upcycle Club.
						</p>
						<p>
							CRIS was entered in the 2019 Congressional App Challenge for Tennessee District 8.  However,
							it did not win; the winning app was simply better than ours in that it had a wider potential
							impact on a larger demographic.
						</p>
						<img src="cris/cec.jpg" class="fullimg">
