							Most notably, policemen and other first responders found themselves in "dire need" â€” as
							Colonel Anthony Rudolph put it â€” of
							face masks for them to wear as they continued to serve the community. To fill this gap, I,
							along with three other high school
							students, led a fundraiser in which over $1,500 was raised to purchase and donate 2,500
							masks to Memphis and Collierville
							police stations.

							both "personal protective equipment"
							and "Protecting Police Effectively".
						</p>
						<p>
							To increase public awareness of our effort, I designed and built <a
								href="https://901ppe.org/">901PPE.org</a>. The website would
							not only increase the legitimacy of 901PPE; it would serve as an important fundraising tool,
							allowing potential donors to quickly
							locate the <a
								href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-provide-masks-for-officers-in-shelby-county">GoFundMe
								page</a> or read more about our mission and motivations. As a link, it would be shorter
							and more memorable than the lengthy GoFundMe URL, meaning
							it could be easily shared and spread in our community.

						<img src="901ppe/masks.jpg" class="fullimg">
						<p class="caption">Our second of three shipments of masks. We had to use different sources
							because of the limited supply around the world.</p>
						<p>
							Within days of going online, 901PPE.org racked up hundreds of views from 5 different
							countries as people shared the link to
							their own friends and inner circles both locally and around the globe. As the ripple effect
							continued, donations began to pour
							in; by the time we ended the fundraiser, almost one hundred people â€” some friends, but the
							majority being names I did not
							recognize â€” had pitched in to our cause.
						</p>
						<p>
							Today, 901PPE.org remains up and serves both to document the delivery of the masks and its
							coverage on local media, as well as to
							be a token of gratitude to the generous donors that made the project possible.
						</p>
						<p>
							In designing the website, I considered several key factors. The website:
							<ul style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif">
								<li>
									Had to be visually impactful. If it did not grab attention immediately, potential
									donors could lose interest upon
									clicking the link. Additionally, a visually impactful website would make the project
									as a whole look more well-organized
									and carefully planned, meaning that potential donors could trust where their money
									was going.
								</li>
								<li>
									Needed to be simple enough that navigation is extremely intuitive and usable. In
									other words, the time looking for
									the donation link needed to be minimized, and information about us and our mission
									needed to be prominently displayed
									to eliminate their need to go digging themselves.
								</li>
								<li>
									Had to be mobile-friendly, and flexible enough to adapt to any kind of device,
									display, browser, etc. Knowing that the
									link would be shared primarily through text and social media such as Instagram,
									Twitter, and Snapchat, mobile-friendliness
									was a key priority.
								</li>
								<li>
									Should have a flexible design that can be changed later. I wanted donors to be able
									to return to this website even after
									the project had ended and still feel familiar with its layout. Thus, even though I
									swapped out links and added new
									content when the project was closed, it still retained the same general flow as
									before. The website was specifically
									designed not to be overly dependent on specific links but instead to be modular
									enough that the feeling of familiarity is
									retained.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<img src="901ppe/landing.jpg" class="fullimg">
						<p class="caption">The landing page of 901PPE.org.</p>
						<p>
							With all these requirements in consideration, I opted to go with a clean, minimalist
							interface based around the symbolic colors
							representative of the police force â€” black, white, and blue â€” and use a single-page flow so
							that users would not have to deal with
							navigation bars, hamburger menus, or dropdowns that could be a pain to deal with (there
							still is a navbar, but it merely scrolls
							to different sections of the same page).
						</p>
						<img src="901ppe/mission.jpg" class="fullimg">
						<p class="caption">Our mission is easily accessible and boldly contrasted with the rest of the
							page so that it is hard to miss.</p>
						<p>
							Finally, I wanted to add some personality, something unique and memorable to the site. When
							the user first loads into 901PPE.org,
							they will see the 901PPE logo surrounded by strange, moving spheres that orbit, connecting
							when they get close together. To me,
							this sketch (coded in WebGL and p5.js) has symbolic importance:
						</p>
						<p>
							As we all travel the path of our own lives, separated from others whether by age, financial
							situation, religious beliefs, race,
							or a contagious virus, it can be easy to grow distant and uncaring to the struggles and
							needs of others. However, it can be
							immensely rewarding to form that new connection, and encourage others nearby to do the same,
							creating a rewarding experience
							for everyone involved. And though as time goes on, and the paths we tread diverge, and the
							connections we make may break,
							the impact lasts forever.
						</p>
						<p>
							This, I believe, is the central message of 901PPE, one that inspired me when I first began
							organizing it as well as one that
							has impacted me permanently in return.

							Every year, our school's math team hosts a "Math Bowl" â€” a fast-paced, buzzer style
							competition featuring math teams from surrounding schools in the Mississippi and
							Tennessee area.
						</p>
						<p>
							The competition lasts a whole day, with preliminary round robin matches taking place
							in the morning followed by a lunch break and a double-elimination tournament in the
							afternoon.  Generally, around 20 teams participate, and matches are spread out in
							10 different classrooms for the preliminary rounds and then moved into a larger
							auditorium space for the final rounds of the tournament.
						</p>
						<img src="mathbowl/room1.jpg" class="fullimg">
						<p class="caption">A round currently in progress (with my software running on the TV)</p>
						<p>
							The background work required to both coordinate and run the event is immense.
							Traditionally, round results have been "run" by student volunteers on paper slips,
							where they would be manually recorded and counted up by a teacher.  Timekeeping was
							done on wristwatches or cell phones, and the score would be tallied by hand on the
							whiteboard.
						</p>
						<p>
							The first time I volunteered as a part of this event, my head was already teeming with
							ideas on how to streamline this old-fashioned process.
						</p>
						<p>
							I began working on a website.  I built the whole thing from scratch; the layouts,
							the logic, the style were all conscious and intentional decisions by me.  The only
							third-party software I used was Firebase (though, in hindsight, I probably should
							have also used React or Vue.js instead of manipulating the DOM using vanilla JS, which,
							as you may see with the code, leads to some pretty ugly and unreadable results).

							all rolled into one.  Features included:
							<ul style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif">
								<li>
									<b>Flexible roster updates:</b> New teams can be added, removed, or renamed through the admin
									dashboard.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Volunteer room assignments:</b> New rooms can be added and removed, and volunteers can be
									assigned or reassigned through the admin dashboard.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Round Robin match auto-generation algorithm:</b> automatically generate the morning match
									schedule, ensuring no team is in the same round twice and giving rooms an equal
									number of breaks.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Unique account system for rooms:</b> each room has its own login associated with the
									room number for running matches and submitting scores.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Match queuing:</b> each room has a set schedule of matches it is assigned to run;
									these matches automatically appear in a list on screen, so it is easy to load the next
									round.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Synchronized round start:</b> each room cannot skip ahead or start rounds ahead of time,
									to ensure rounds start and finish at around the same times (minimizing the wait times
									for the students between rounds).
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Customized display for each round:</b> teams entering rooms are able to see their
									team names on the screen, to verify that they are in the right place.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Score and time display:</b> teams are able to see the score and timer as the round
									progresses, as well as the current question number.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Keyboard shortcuts for timer and score operation:</b> Volunteers can operate the timer
									with maximum speed and ease, which is critical as this is a time-sensitive tournament.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Live score updates:</b> In the auditorium, where parents and coaches waited between rounds,
									the scores for each room are updated live on the large projector display.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Admin dashboard analytics:</b> On the front page of the admin dashboard, people in charge of the
									competition can view analytics for question difficulty and team performance.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Admin dashboard progress monitoring:</b> On the front page of the admin dashboard, there is a
									pie chart of rooms that have not started their rounds, rooms that are currently running a round,
									and rooms that have completed the round.  This can be used to check on rooms that are having
									issues or to know when to allow teams to move to their next round.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Round completion detection:</b> The software automatically determines when a round is complete
									or if the round should continue with tiebreakers if the score is even.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Automatic score reporting:</b> as each round is finished, scores are automatically recorded
									in the database.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Schedule display between rounds:</b> especially in the afternoon, as teams become eliminated,
									the schedule is not set for which team will appear in which room.  To aid this, the display
									in the auditorium can automatically show where teams are supposed to be for the next round.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Admin console display control:</b> The display in the auditorium can be controlled via a click
									of a button in the admin dashboard, and toggled between various display modes.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Disputes management system:</b> If, after a round, there are disputes on certain questions,
									scores can be modified, added, or deleted in the admin console.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Rank calculation algorithm:</b> Teams are ranked from preliminary round results based on total
									wins; if some teams have the same number of wins, the tie is broken by total number of questions
									answered corrrectly.  This is useful in determining seeds for the double-elimination bracket.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Graceful disconnect recovery:</b> If the Wi-Fi suddenly is disconnected during a round, the round
									can continue, and results will be reported automatically behind the scenes when a connection
									is reestablished.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Abandonment/disqualification cleaning:</b> If a team drops out or is disqualified between rounds,
									the system can automatically find and delete matches originally queued with that team.
								</li>

							On the day of the Math Bowl, I (do I even need to say this?) was extremely nervous.  I had taken this
							responsibility upon myself, to build something so large and complex in such a short time period;
							if it broke, the competition itself would break.  I had never tested it on such a scale; sure, I had
							tested it on two or three computers at once, but not with volunteers who had never seen the software
							before.
						</p>
						<p>
							The outcome, however, makes me remember why I love to code in the first place.  Everything ran more smoothly
							than I could have imagined. Besides a few hiccups in round one (in which some scores somehow got reported twice,
							glitching the rank calculation algorithm) which were quickly resolved, the day went incredibly well.

							hands had built â€” as the first scores first began to trickle in.
						</p>
						<p>
							It is even harder to describe the feeling that I felt as I watched others benefit from my work, whether they were

							According to the USDA, approximately 133 billion pounds of food was wasted
							in 2010.
						</p>
						<p>
							We throw away old or bruised apples; we toss out peels; we cut off huge chunks
							of fruits and vegetables due to the presence of one small brown spot.
						</p>
						<p>
							At the same time, the land we live on continues to be deprived of nutrients
							and the soil must be artificially augmented with chemical fertilizers in order
							to continue to support our wasteful food demands.
						</p>
						<img src="cris/info.jpg" class="fullimg">
						<p class="caption"></p>
						<p>
							Composting is one tool to remedy this growing problem.  By returning nutrients from
							organic materials back to the soil instead of shipping them off to landfills,
							composting is an environmentally-friendly way to cut food waste as well as costs for
							other items such as fertilizers.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, composting is a daunting process to get into; it is often unclear to beginners
							what can and cannot be composted, and in what ratio to compost different food items to
							achieve the best soil qualities.
						</p>
						<p>
							To remedy this, I partnered with Collierville High School's Upcycle Club to create an
							app that would make it easier to find information about composting.
						</p>
						<p>
							The app was named "CRIS", or Compost Recognition Image Software; however, its features
							extend beyond its name.  While its primary feature is indeed a camera that can recognize
							compost scraps and recommend the best strategy to work with them, users can also read
							helpful curated articles about tips and tricks to achieve the best results, and they can
							also browse the catalog using an intelligent custom-built search engine.

							and operating systems to ensure maximum compatibility.  The information in the app was
							compiled with the gracious help of the CHS Upcycle Club.

						<p>
							CRIS was entered in the 2019 Congressional App Challenge for Tennessee District 8.  However,

							Starting in 7th grade, I have been a part of some form of robotics team every
							year.  I started in 7th grade with an FTC team in its first year; in 8th grade,
							I became the captain of the team.  In my freshman year of high school, I joined
							the school's FRC team as a programmer, and in 10th grade I became the lead
							programmer.  In 11th grade, I helped form a new independent VEX Robotics team.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can find a more general account of my experience on <a href="#">my blog</a>.
							I highly encourage you to read it; it provides more context and backstory for my
							time in robotics.
						</p>
						<h3>ftc-mecanum</h3>
						<p>
							While I had left the FTC team that I helped create when I moved on to high school,
							I never lost my connection to the team. I continued to volunteer
							hundreds of hours of my spare time to serving as a programming mentor, teaching
							middle school students who had never programmed before in their lives how to write
							basic Java.
						<p>
							This repository contains well-documented,
							clean Java code for programming a mecanum drive base.  
							As a mecanum base is one of the more complicated (or arguably the most
							complicated, for FTC) drive bases to program, it was necessary to guide them at
							every step of the way.
						</p>
						<h3>2018-PowerUp</h3>
						<p>
							2017 was the year I entered 9th grade and joined the Dragon Robotics FRC team. Despite
							being completely new to the organization, I immediately began to help create a major
							change within the programming team. Instead of using Java, as the team had for its
							entire history, I helped transition the team into using Python for the robot instead.
						</p>
						<img src="robot/1.jpg" class="fullimg">
						<p class="caption">Our 2017-2018 bot, nicknamed "Toothless" for its dragon-like yet derpy appearance.</p>
						<p>
							Python is good for several reasons.  For one, it is much easier to read and write,
							meaning more inexperienced programmers could have a chance to contribute.  In addition,
							it is more flexible than Java (dynamic types and first-class functions), enabling us
							to more easily take advantage of programming patterns such as finite-state automata and
							pipelines.
						</p>
						<p>
							I also implemented a <i>swerve</i> drivetrain in Python.  Swerve drive is the most complex
							base, using 8 motors; for each corner of the robot, there is a motor that turns the wheel,
							and another motor that turns the entire module, enabling the wheel to have 360Â° of pivot freedom.
						</p>
						<p>
							Because of this, swerve drive can enable the robot to move with ultimate freedom; it can pivot around one corner,
							drive in a straight line while rotating, drive in smooth arcs, or even lock itself in place to avoid
							being pushed around by moving its wheels into an X formation.
						</p>
						<p>
							As mentioned earlier, the autonomous code took advantage of finite-state automata, a pattern
							made a lot more elegant using Python's first class functions.  This enabled a great degree
							of flexibility and ensured coordination between the different subsystems on the robot.
						</p>
						<img src="robot/2.jpg" class="fullimg">
						<p class="caption">The team at the 2018 Rock City Regional.</p>
						<h3>2019-DeepSpace</h3>
						<p>
							When the previous programming lead graduated, I had the most experience with programming the robot on
							the team; as a result, I took over the programming lead position.
						</p>
						<p>
							I opted to continue using Python for the 2018-2019 season with a focus on user-friendliness, flexibility,
							and modularity.  I used the state machine pattern in driver-controlled code for the first time to control
							the lift and the claw; this allowed for extremely safe yet responsive control of those subsystems.
							Additionally, I introduced the idea of a <i>config.py</i> file, which contained only global constants used to
							control settings like how sensitive a control was, or what a certain button mapped to.  This was important
							because it meant that even non-programmers, especially the drivers, who were often from the build team, could
							adjust and modify how the robot behaved to their liking without having to sift through code.
						</p>
						<img src="robot/5.jpg" class="fullimg">
						<p class="caption">The 2018-2019 bot, with its unique expanding claw and LED's on the side (off in this picture).</p>
						<p>
							Finally, we implemented code to control LED strips on our robot for the first time.  The LEDs are intended
							to communicate to the driver different statuses on the robot. But, as a side bonus, they just look super cool
							too.

						<p class="caption">The two bots of my FRC career; on the left, the Deep Space bot; on the right, the Power Up bot.  Countless
						hours of hard work and good memories captured in one image!</p>
						<h3>2020-TowerTakeover</h3>
						<p>
							After the 2018-2019 season, for various reasons (which you can find on my blog), I decided to leave the FRC team
							and help form a new independent VEX program outside of the school.
						</p>
						<p>
							This was my first year doing VEX, and I served as the sole programmer on the team.  Despite this, I adapted quickly
							to the C++-based programming environment and brought over many of the principles that I had carefully enforced in my
							time on FRC: flexibility, modularity, and statefulness.
						</p>
						<p>
							Although the robot design was constantly in flux, as different iterations were tested and failed, the code itself was
							extremely easy to work with due to the modularity built into the code.  Code for different modules was always
							separated like oil and water; when the design of the robot was changed, all that needed to be done was simply
							swap one of the modules out, and the robot would function exactly as expected.

							These are smaller side-projects that I wrote mostly for my own use.  However,
							I thought it would be nice to give examples of how I use programming as a tool in my daily life.
						</p>
						<h3>Processing Sketches</h3>
						<p>
							Okay, so maybe the whole right-brain/left-brain thing is a myth, but I'm definitely the kind of
							person who is better at the concrete â€” math, science, programming â€” than the abstract.  My
							creativity skills are sorely lacking.
						</p>
						<p>
							In order to remedy this, I occasionally do a sketch using <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>,
							a graphics program built on Java.  Besides being exercises in code, the sketches also force me to flex my
							creative muscles; I imagine an end result (or see some inspiring art online that I would like to replicate)
							and try to create it using code.
						</p>
						<img src="etc/sketch1.png" class="fullimg">
						<p class="caption">One of my sketches, called "ripples" for its fabric-like appearance. Based on random noise generation.</p>
						<img src="etc/sketch2.png" class="fullimg">
						<p class="caption">A bit of a different style of sketch, this one draws from real photos to generate spiral artwork.</p>
						<p> 
							This repository is an incomplete archive of my sketches.  They are not particularly awe-inspiring by any means, and I would
							hesitate to even call them <i>art</i>, but they are an example of exercises I do in my own time to simultaneously
							get faster at programming and become more creative.
						</p>
						<h3>Web2Anki</h3>
						<p>
							This python script arose from my personal efforts to get better at reading and writing Chinese.  My strategy
							was to memorize the 1,000 most common Hanzi characters and then gradually learn the rest by reading and using
							context clues.
						</p>
						<p>
						The flashcards software I planned to use was Anki, a spaced-recognition software that allows for greater long-term
						retention of material by ordering cards based on how frequently you miss them.
						</p>
						<p>
						However, 1,000 flash cards is an amount that I have neither the time nor the motivation to make.  So, I wrote a script
						that did it for me.
						</p>
						<img src="etc/anki.png" class="fullimg">
						<p class="caption">A deck generated by Web2Anki. The formatting is fully flexible, and you can easily tweak formatting
						for all of the cards even after the deck is imported into Anki.</p>
						<p>
						Web2Anki converts Wikipedia tables and Quizlet flashcards to Anki decks.  It is actually quite flexible in doing so;
						the columns of the Wikipedia table can be used in any way, and the formatting can be customized.  For example,
						I can create a deck of Chinese characters from <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Mandarin_Frequency_lists/1-1000">this Wiktionary page</a> using this command:
						</p>
						<code>./web2anki.py https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Mandarin_Frequency_lists/1-1000 "{{col1}}" "{{col2}}: {{col3}}" "1000 Hanzi" output.apkg</code>
						<p>
							which will output a deck with cards formatted like so:
							<ul style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif">
								<li>Front of card: <code>æˆ‘</code></li>
								<li>Back of card: <code>wÇ’: I, me, ego, self</code></li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							Note how columns 3 and 4 of the table were combined for the back of the card.
						</p>
						<p>
							I used this script for more than studying Chinese; when studying for Science Olympiad or the Tennessee Science Bowl,
							I frequently created decks to memorize tables of information using this script.  Furthermore, this script
							can easily be extended to support additional websites in the future if I need to.
						</p>
						<h3>MathTrainer</h3>
						<p>
							Though my symbolic math strength is quite well-developed, I can't say the same for my numerical strength; in other words,
							while I can solve algebraic equations, manipulate matrices, integrate expressions, and solve differential equations just 
							fine, I'm quite slow when adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing actual numbers compared to some of my math 
							friends.
						</p>
						<p>
							Especially for contest math tests like the AMC and the AIME, not being able to quickly bash out numbers can be a huge
							bottleneck.  And because I'm very inexperienced with contest math, I need all the time I can get to think about the 
							problems.
						</p>
						<p>
							That means I needed to get faster at working with numbers.
						</p>
						<p>
							MathTrainer was a program that I wrote that would randomly generate mental math problems for me to solve.
							I can customize what types of problems are included or excluded, as well as the number of problems per sprint.
							After each sprint, MathTrainer reports back to me with all of the problems, whether I got them wrong or right,
							and my average time overall.
						</p>
						<p>
							It is an extremely flexible tool, either when I want to grind a specific topic or work on quickly switching gears
							and solve a wide range of problems.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition, I find it a great way to "gamify" my math preparation; I compete against my old fastest records and see
							if I can push the time even lower.  By taking this competitive mindset, I become incentivized to constantly improve.
