## "Recent" photos from my camera roll (depending on when I remember to update it)

*I got to go on a tour of The Washington Post's printing press! I went in
expecting kind of just a glorified printer; it's not at all that. The sheer
scale and efficiency is breathtaking. The passion of the people working at the
plant who took us on the tour also made the whole experience super engaging
and interesting -- and also made me kind of sad that the peak of this magical
era (of presses running at full steam through the night, printing copies for
millions of households) has passed, with software engineers like me mostly to
blame.*

*Fireworks in the National Mall on the 4th of July. I was sitting at the
Lincoln Memorial. There was an unbelievable number of people there; I arrived
20 minutes early and slowly wormed my way through the crowd until I found a
decent spot to sit down and watch.*

*My first time trying Nepali cuisine! Really delicious. The dish I got was
called ghar ko thali; from left to right, a rice pudding for dessert, black
lentil dal, spinach, bean/potato/bamboo curry, and a goat curry. Picked radish
on the side as well. I also got momos and sel roti.*

*I stumbled upon this quaint little bookshop in DC. There were books absolutely
everywhere: piled from floor to ceiling, stuffed horizontally above other
shelved books, stacked on the window, hanging above the doorway, you name it.
And tons of whimsical little notes and labels scattered about to help navigate.
I could spend weeks here! (Shop is Capitol Hill Books, near Eastern Market)*

*On this night, there were supposed to be northern lights visible in much of the
country. Some of my friends and I rented a car and drove out into rural Rhode
Island, where we stopped at this bridge overlooking a reservoir. We didn't get
to see any auroras, but after a few minutes of adjusting to the dark we could
see beautiful stars in the night sky reflecting on the water below. Such a
tranquil and serene experience.*

*A beautiful spring day at Brown. Some of my most contented memories are coming
out of a long study session at the library, feeling the gentle warmth of sun on
my back, breathing in the fresh, cool air, and listening to the breeze rustling
through the branches of the flowering trees.*
