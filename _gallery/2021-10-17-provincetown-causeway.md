For my first Family Weekend at Brown, my dad came to visit and together we drove
to the small town of Provincetown on the furthest tip of Cape Cod. We ended the
day on the Provincetown Causeway, watching the Sun set on one side and the
purple night rise on the other as the tide slowly climbed higher.

The white specks on the rock are shards of clam shells, left by seagulls who
crack the shells open by picking the clam up and dropping it from some height
onto the rock below.
