An old Providence tradition, Brown always sponsors one WaterFire in October
during Family Weekend. Though simple, there is something mesmerizing about it,
sitting by the river, absorbing the warmth of the flame, and watching volunteers
on boats go from brazier to brazier refilling wood which transforms soft
flickers back into roaring fires. The festival is accompanied by food trucks,
public performances, and local shops, making for a lively community occasion.
