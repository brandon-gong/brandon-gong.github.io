It's surprisingly easy to forget you're working for a news organization when
your job is deep inside the engineering division, so this tour of The
Washington Post's printing facility really made everything feel "real" to me
and is perhaps my best memory of being an intern there.

There's something breathtaking about seeing the multi-story printers in action
and imagining the sheer scale of what can be produced there (it was a little
quieter during our visit, but I'm told at night the whole facility rumbles with
life when the bulk of printing operations happens). At the same time, there's a
sense of wistfulness, as with the shift towards digital consumption the era of
these great machines operating at such a scale is drawing to a close.
