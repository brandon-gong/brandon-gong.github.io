I had decided I wanted to explore more of the Northeast before moving away after
graduating college, so I hopped on the MBTA, transferring to North Station in
Boston, and took the train to Rockport. Though the town does feel decently
geared towards tourists, the season had not arrived yet (indeed, it was even a
few degrees colder than Boston due to being on the coast), and furthermore with
the gloomy weather I found myself in a bit of a ghost town. It does, however,
still have the quaint vibe and rocky beaches of the Northeast that I have come
to love.
