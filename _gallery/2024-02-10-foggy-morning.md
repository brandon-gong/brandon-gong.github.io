I woke up relatively early (by college student standards) to go fetch a birthday
cake for a friend from a local bakery in downtown Providence, which sits across
the Providence River from Brown's campus. Arriving at the pedestrian bridge in
the peaceful morning hours, I found it wrapped in a blanket of fog, the opposite
riverbank totally occluded by the mist.
