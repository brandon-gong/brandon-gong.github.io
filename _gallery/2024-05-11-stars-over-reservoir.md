There was supposed to be aurora visible over Rhode Island on this day, so
we formed a group and drove out into rural Rhode Island to try to see them for
ourselves. We ended up parking on a bridge over the Scituate Reservoir, joining
a few other locals who seemed to be in the area for the same reason.

Unfortunately, there were clouds, which meant no aurora for us. But sitting
there, stars overhead and the perfectly tranquil reservoir below, silence save
for the periodic whoosh of cars driving over the bridge, was still such a
serene and meditative experience.

(Note: Although it looks like dusk in the photo, it was in reality almost pitch
black; this is just the iPhone night mode camera working in overtime. Though
it disturbs the effect, I'm pretty impressed by what it's capable of; there's
even the reflection of a star in the reservoir below.)
