I found this long stairway at the end of Post Alley, where the gum wall is.
Stairs of this height usually have switchbacks (I mean the ones where you go
down a flight, turn 180 degrees on a flat landing, and then go down another
flight), so seeing it all in one straight path stretched out against the sky
like this makes it an oddly striking bit of architecture.
