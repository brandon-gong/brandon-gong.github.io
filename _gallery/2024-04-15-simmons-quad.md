Though I loved the colorful autumns and crisp winters at Brown, my favorite
season will always be spring, where the many flowering trees scattered around
campus bloom beautiful hues of pink, yellow, and purple. Some of my best
memories are of coming out of a library after a few hours of hard work,
breathing in the fresh air, and listening to the sound of the wind through the
petals mixing with that of students playing spikeball or lounging about in the
warmer weather.
