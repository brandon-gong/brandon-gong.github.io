Just a few steps away from the bustle of Ghirardelli Square, I found this
quartet of small red and white boats bobbing in the gentle ripples of the Bay.
Knowing absolutely nothing about boats, it does make me curious why they're
sitting so far out from shore, like toy boats drifting away in a bathtub.
