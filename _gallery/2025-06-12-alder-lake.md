After driving for some time on the way from SeaTac Airport to Mt. Rainier, one
emerges from the rural tangle of shrubs and trees onto this gorgeous, open view
of Alder Lake and the mountains around it.

I later learned this lake is actually a reservoir, and so water levels rise and
fall with the seasons. The lower-elevation trees whose roots would be drowned by
these fluctuations have been cut, leaving only their stumps behind, surrounded
by soft grasses which can regrow from year to year.
