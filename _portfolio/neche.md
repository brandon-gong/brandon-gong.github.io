This project evolved small neural networks to play checkers. Networks were given
32 "sensory neurons" – to look at the different individual squares on the board
– as well as some inner neurons. From there, they could freely define the
network structure and weights. They output a single evaluation score, which
a minimax algorithm (with alpha-beta pruning) used to explore future variations.

A "population" of several hundred networks would play a tournament-ish format
against itself each generation; the more successful networks that won more games
were more likely to become parents to the offspring in the next generation of
the population.

Network structure was encoded in a genome, where each 16-base pair gene encoded
a single synapse from one neuron to another. To create offspring, crossing-over
was simulated between the two parent genomes, and translocation and point
mutations were induced.

This project was built in Rust, using the `rayon` crate to run each
generational tournament in parallel. All evolution, tree search, and move
move generation features were implemented from scratch.

I undertook this project to learn Rust and explore this novel idea that was
brewing in my head for quite a while.
