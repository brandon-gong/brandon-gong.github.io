I'm a software engineer at Roblox, specifically in networking infrastructure.

Previously, I studied applied math and computer science at Brown University and
served as a teaching assistant for Computer Networks (CSCI 1680) and Operating
Systems (CSCI 1690). I also worked as an engineering intern at The Washington
Post for a few summers on their backend subscription services.

On the side, I enjoy playing classical piano, trying to stay active, and
learning random tidbits from my favorite blogs (do check out [Eukaryote Writes
Blog](https://eukaryotewritesblog.com/){:target="_blank"},
[brr](https://brr.fyi/){:target="_blank"}, and [Jake
Seliger](https://jakeseliger.com/){:target="_blank"}!). This site is a humble
attempt at making my own contribution in this space.

No generative AI is used in the making of this website; all code and content
is written by me.
