Iâ€™m currently a Data Science Research Associate at Axle Informatics, working
with the National Institutes of Health.

I'm a second-year undergraduate at Brown University, concentrating
in Computer Science and Mathematics. I've also taken classes in immunology,
economics, visual art, and more. I post regularly to my [blog]({% link blog.md
%}), documenting my new learnings / recent toy programs.

Coding is my favorite hobby! Doing personal [projects]({% link projects.md %})
has given me the ability to quickly orient myself in new languages or
frameworks. It's also made me sharper at reading and debugging unfamiliar code.
These are skills that can't be found in the classroom.

When I'm not sitting at the computer, I enjoy cooking, practicing piano, hiking,
and playing tennis.

Let's get in touch! You can find me at any of my [links]({% link links.md %}),
grab a copy of my [resume]({{site.baseurl}}resume.pdf), or reach out to me via
email at _brandon \[dot] gong \[at] brandongong.org_.
